# IPFS Gorilla REPL Viewer

Gorilla is a rich REPL for Clojure in the notebook style. If you're interested you should take a look at its
[website](http://gorilla-repl.org).

This is a version of the viewer supports files on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and is hosted on IPFS itself.

## Instructions
[Original functionality](http://gorilla-repl.org/viewer.html) is still supported.
To view files on IPFS the following can be appended to the viewer address:
- IPFS: `/view.html?source=ipfs&hash=<ipfs-hash>`
- IPNS: `/view.html?source=ipns&hash=<ipns-hash>`
